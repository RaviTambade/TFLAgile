# User Story
<img src="/images/UserStories/00_UserStories.jpg"/>
Developing user stories(an informal, natural description of your customer’s potential online journey) can help guide the development of your user experience, product management, web design, and more.
A user story is an informal, natural description of your customer’s potential online journey. These stories should be written using non-technical language to provide context to the development team. In agile software development, user stories are specifically written from an end-user perspective, describing the type of user, what they want, and why they want it. How often do your teams read a complex, long, technical requirements document? User stories cut through the density while still providing essential communication to teams responsible for designing and implementing user-focused systems. User Stories ensure delivery of rapidly-developed, cost-effective, and customer-centric experiences.
<p>A user story is typically told in one sentence.</p>
Following the format:
<p><b> “As a [persona], I want to [need], so that [purpose].”</b> </p>

* <b>Persona:</b> The end user’s character
* <b>Need: </b>The goal the software feature has on the end user’s journey
* <b>Purose:</b> The goal of the end user’s experience with the software feature

### Examples of User Story
* As a customer, I need to authenticate myself, so that I can see my account details and past orders
* As a customer, I need to be informed of the benefits of the loyalty program, so that I benefit from the program.
* As a customer I want to able to submit feedback, so that the website owners can consider my opinion or concern during future website updates.
* As a signed-in user I want to able to comment on a blog post, so that I can get feedback on issues.
* As a credit card holder, I want to view my statement (or account) balance, so that I can pay the balance due.
* As a teacher, I want to generate assessment report, so that I can evaluate student performance.
* As a User I want to view a list of products, so that I can select some to purchase
* As a Marketing Lead, I want to have a content management system, so that I can manage and provide quality content and experience to my readers
* As a Content Owner, I want to be able to create product content, so that I can provide information and market to customers.
* As an Editor, I want to review content before it is published, so that I can assure it is optimized with correct grammar and tone.
* As a customer, I want to be able to create an account, save my payment information, and view my order history, so that I can have a personalized shopping experience and easily track my purchases.
* As a customer, I want to be able to view product details, including images, descriptions, prices, and customer reviews, so I can make informed purchasing decisions.
* As a customer, I want to be able to apply discount codes, promotions, and gift cards to my purchase, so that I can take advantage of special offers and discounts.
* As a customer, I want to receive email notifications about my order status, including order confirmation, shipping updates, and delivery notifications, so that I can stay informed about my purchases.
* As a customer, I want to be able to provide feedback and reviews on products, so that I can share my experiences and help other customers make informed purchasing decisions.
* As a store owner, I want to be able to manage my product inventory, update product details, and track sales and revenue, so that I can effectively manage my online store and make data-driven decisions about my business.
* As a marketing manager, I want to view real-time dashboards of customer behavior and engagement, so that I can optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer retention.
* As a sales representative, I want to access detailed reports on customer interactions and sales performance, so that I can identify sales trends and opportunities to improve performance.
* As a finance analyst, I want to generate ad-hoc reports on financial metrics and KPIs, so that I can analyze financial performance and identify areas for cost reduction and optimization.
* As an operations manager, I want to monitor key performance indicators for operational efficiency, such as cycle time, throughput, and inventory levels, so that I can identify opportunities to improve operational performance.
* As a product manager, I want to track customer feedback and sentiment data, so that I can identify customer needs and preferences and make data-driven decisions about product development and marketing.


### Tips for achieving an effective user story
An effective user story should follow the<b> 3 Cs</b> and</b> INVEST</b> acronym. 
Both of these help to take your user stories to the next level, resulting in more effective software updates. 
#### 3 Cs
The 3 Cs break each user story into three different benchmarks, creating a more organized process: 
* <b>Card:</b> A written description of the user story used for sprint planning. To create and share story cards, try using a work management tool. 
* <b>Conversation: </b>A discussion between customers, users, and developers around the priority and potential solutions to the user story.
* <b>Confirmation:</b> An agreement between stakeholders that user story objectives and solutions have been reached.
The 3 Cs help to break down a user story into simple tasks. This gives a clear direction for involved stakeholders.
### INVEST
Agile teams assess the quality of stories by using the INVEST acronym: 
* <b>Independent</b>: The user story should be independent of all others. Because they are not connected, they can be worked on in any order.
* <b>Negotiable:</b> A user story should be flexible enough to allow for negotiation between the customer and product owner.
* <b>Valuable: </b>What value does the user story bring? If you cannot find any value, the story should not be completed.
* Estimable: You should be able to estimate how long a user story will take so that you can effectively manage your time.
* <b>Small:</b> The story must be small enough to be completed within a single sprint.
* <b>Testable:</b> You must be able to test your user story in line with quality assurance standards.


### Steps for writing a good user story
A user story is written in three steps and represents the end user’s viewpoint. 
#### Step 1. Identify the persona
Identify the end user’s persona by evaluating your target audience. Consider who will be impacted by the software feature. 
Here are some questions to ask yourself and your team when identifying the user persona:
* Who are we building this software feature for?
* What kind of product features does the end user want?
* What are the demographics and psychographics of the end user?
There may be multiple personas in a given user story depending on the size of the target audience. 
##### Example persona:<b> Kat, a project manager who leads 10 team members</b>

#### Step 2. Describe the need
Describe how the end user will use your software feature and why. This is critical so your team understands why the target audience would use your feature in the first place. 
Consider these questions when analyzing the intent of the end user:
* What is the end user trying to accomplish?
* How will your software feature help the end user accomplish their goals?
Avoid focusing on the specific features—instead, consider what the end user is searching for and how your software will help them reach their goals. 
##### Example need: <b>Help team members understand how individual tasks contribute to larger business goals</b>

#### Step 3. Define the purpose
Define the purpose by analyzing the bigger picture of the software release. Consider how the software feature fits into your internal goals. 
Ask yourself these questions to help define the purpose:
* What’s the benefit of the software feature?
* What is the problem that’s being solved?
* How does this fit into larger goals?
The purpose here is to define the value of your software feature related to big-picture goals.

##### Example purpose: <b>To increase efficiency by creating a clear path</b>


## The Anatomy of a User Story

Agile User Stories are short and simple.

### The Feature

<p>The feature represents the product increment.</p>
<p>The Feature should be written in this format:</p>
<p> <b>As a <who>, I need to <what> so that <why>.</b> </p>

For example: <b> “As an online customer, I need to search for products, so that I can find the ones I want to buy.” </b>
<p>This short sentence alone conveys three key pieces of information:</p>
<b>Who cares about this feature?</b> (the shopper)  <b>What do they want?</b> (to search products) <b>Why do they want it?</b> (so they can buy some)


#### Examples of Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria should cover all the nuances that must be built in the product in order to implement the feature. While the feature is written from the user’s point of view, the acceptance criteria is written from the product’s point of view. 
<p><b>As an online customer, I need to search for products, so that I can find the ones I want to buy.</b> </p>
 Accptance criteria:
    Search for a product by name or category
    View products by category
    View images and details for each product
    Add to cart from the detail or search pages

It is important to clearly number each acceptance criteria. This makes it easier to reference during refinement, demos, and acceptance testing.

<p><b>As a website user I want to able to search on the webpage So that I can find necessary information.</b></p>
Acceptance Scenario:

    Given that I’m in a role of registered or guest user

    When I open the “Products” page
    Then the system shows me the list of all products
    And the system shows the “Search” section in the right top corner of the screen

    When I fill in the “Search” field with the name of existing item in the product list
    And I click the “Apply” button OR press the Enter key on keyboard
    Then the system shows products in the Search Results section with product names matching entered product name
    And the system shows the number of search results in the top of the Search Results section”

<p><b>As a website user I want to able to submit feedback So that the website owners can consider my opinion or concern during future website updates</b></p>
Acceptance Scenario:
   
    User submits feedback form with the valid data

    Given I’m in a role of logged-in or guest user
    When I open the Feedback page
    Then the system shows me the Submit Feedback form containing “Email”,“Name” and “Comment” fields which are required

    When I fill in the “Email” field with a valid email address
    And I fill in the “Name” field with my name
    And I fill in the “Comment” field with my comment
    And I click the “Submit Feedback” button
    Then the system submits my feedback
    And the system shows the “You’ve successfully submitted your feedback” flash message
    And the system clears the fields of the Submit Feedback form”

Acceptance Criteria:
   
    Scenario 1: Successful authentication</b> When the user enters the correct email address and password and selects “sign-in” CTA, then route the user to My Account home page and display signed-in status on header.
    Scenario 2: Unsuccessful authentication</b> When the user enters an incorrect combination of email address and password and selects “sign-in” CTA ,then reset credentials fields and display an error message “Incorrect Credentials”
    Scenario 3: Forgot credentials</b> When the user selects the “forgot credentials” CTA Then route the user to the “forgot credentials” page
    Scenario 4: Register</b> When the user selects the “register” CTA ,then route the user to the “registration” page


<p><b>As a signed-in user I want to able to comment on a blog post So that I can get feedback on issues</b></p>
Acceptance scenario:
   
    Given I’m in a role of signed-in user
    When I open the page with a specific blog post, then the system shows the “Comments” section below the blog post with the list of comments added by other users and the system shows the “Add a Comment” field in the top of the “Comments” section
    When I fill in the “Add a Comment” field with my comment and I click the “Submit” button, Then the system saves my comment and the system shows my comment in the top of the “Comments” section and the system shows my username and profile picture on the left side from my comment and the system shows “Remove” and “Edit” icons opposite my comment

<p><b>As a project manager, I want to review workflow management software so I can choose a new platform for my team.</b></p>
Acceptance criteria:
   
    Ensure that user reviews and testimonials are published on our product site.
    Verify that user reviews for our product are available on third-party forums.
    Proactively acquire new user reviews by sending feedback requests to current users and past clients.

<p><b>As a credit card holder, I want to view my statement (or account) balance, so that I can pay the balance due.</b></p>
Acceptance criteria:
   
    Display statement balance upon authentication. Say for example $1560
    Display total balance. For example $3560. Here the balance due from the current period is $2560 and past balance due is $2000.
    Show Minimum payment due. For example $140
    Show Payment due date. For example May 16th of the current month
    Show error message if service not responding or timeout. For example ‘Sorry, something went wrong with the service. Please try again.’

<p><b>As a teacher, I want to generate assessment report, so I can evaluate student performance.</b></p>
Acceptance criteria:
   
    Show a student’s current assessment score.
    Display past assessment score of the student.
    Provide an option to Print / Save / Share. (By the way, this could be split as a separate user story by itself).
    Display error message if service not responding. (If a team chooses to add the Error Message as their definition of done for all stories –ere ever applicable, it could be omitted from the acceptance criteria).

<p><b>As a User I want to view a list of products so I can select some to purchase</b><p>
Acceptance Criteria:
   
    See a thumbnail image for each product
    Click to view details for product
    Add to cart from detail page
    Search for a product
    View products by category


## Types of User Stories
<img src="/images/UserStories/0_Types of User Stories.webp" width="400" height="400" />
Once a Product Owner is able to recognize the type of story needed, it becomes easier for them to focus on the criteria that are important for the story acceptance. 

#### 1.Behavior-Driven Stories

<img src="/images/UserStories/2_BehaviourProductShoe.webp" />

These are stories where the user’s actions or decisions are the focus.
 These stories typically have a number of scenarios to be considered.
<p> <b>As a customer, I need to authenticate myself so that I can see my account details and past orders.</b></p>
Multiple  scenarios:
   
    1:User entered the correct credentials for authentication
    2:User entered incorrect credentials for authentication
    3:User realizes that they forgot the credentials
    4:User realizes that they do not have an account, and wants to create one now

### 2.Rules-Driven Stories
There are also stories where the focus needs to be on the business rules. The user actions do not have much relevance within the scope of the story (there could be related stories where the user action is in focus).
<img src="/images/UserStories/3_ruleDrivenUS.webp" />

<p> <b>As a customer searching for a product, I need to be presented the most appropriate choices, so that I am likely to find what I am looking for.</b></p>
This story is about the business rules to be built to support search. There would be other stories to cover the user behavior around using the ‘search’ function. 

Acceptance criteria:

    1) For finding the products that match the search criteria, use the following attributes in the order listed below.
        * Product name
        * Product variation name 
        * Product short description
        * Product long description
        * Product reviews
    2) For finding the categories that match the search criteria, use the following attributes in the order listed below.
        * Category name
        * Category short description    
    3) Both full and partial match should be attempted.
    4) For a partial match, at least 3 characters should match.
    5) Ignore all standard stop words while attempting a match.
    6) Use synonyms to find a match. Refer to <link> for the list of synonyms.
    7) A minimum of 3 characters needs to be entered to find a match.

### 3.Content-Driven Stories
These are stories that revolve around content generation and display.
<img src="/images/UserStories/4_contentdrivenus.webp" />
The content-driven stories are a hybrid between behavior-driven and rules-driven stories. They do have a behavior aspect, but the rules behind the content generation/display are often more complex than the user behavior itself. 

So, a rules-driven format is more suitable than a behavior-driven format for the acceptance criteria. How it differs from a rules-driven story is that the acceptance criteria, in this case, will need to refer to several snippets from the design pages and/or copy documents for it to be complete.

Keep in mind that the need for many of these stories are likely to come up only when UX/UI discussions happen. So it’s quite possible that none of these stories show up when the Product Owner does the first round of user story mapping with the product stakeholders.

<p> <b>“As a customer, I need to be informed of the benefits of the loyalty program so that I benefit from the program.</b></p>
Acceptance criteria:

    1) The loyalty program benefits needs to be displayed as a banner over the header.
    2) It should be possible to configure via the administration console the date range during which this banner needs to be displayed. The user should be mandated to enter both the ‘from’ and ‘to’ dates for the date range.
    The banner should automatically appear and disappear according to the date range.
    3) It should be possible to configure the banner such that it is personalized for each user. The following four user segments should be available for this configuration.
        * Anonymous user
        * Signed-in user who is not a loyalty program member
        * Signed-in user who is a loyalty program member but has no loyalty points
        * Signed-in user who is a loyalty program member and has at least one loyalty point
    4) For each user segment, it should be possible to configure the image and the link upon clicking the image.
    5) Set up the banner with the following images and links.
        * Anonymous user - <image link> - link to “registration page”
        * Signed-in user who is not a loyalty program member - <image link> - link to “profile page”
        * Signed-in user who is a loyalty program member but has no loyalty points - <image link> - no link
        * Signed-in user who is a loyalty program member and has at least one loyalty point - <image link> - no link

    6) When the banner has not been configured (correctly) for a specific user segment, then do not display the banner for those users.

### 4.Improvement Stories
There are often situations where we need to make a small improvement over a story that has already been built. 
Here is an example. Let’s say we had a site where all the error messages on the registration page were in ‘black’ color. After getting some real customer feedback, it was understood that the error messages need to be in ‘red’ color for them to be noticed. So we would have a story that goes as follows.
<p> <b>As a customer trying to register for an account, I need to be informed clearly if I am making any errors, so that I can fix them quickly. </b></p>
Acceptance criteria:

    Change the font color of all error messages in registration page to ‘red’ for all error scenarios. 


### 5.Integration Stories
When building a product backlog, there will be a need to write stories that result in a technical integration work. For example, between eCommerce store and OMS (Order Management System), or between eCommerce Store and a Payment Gateway. 
Figuring out the technical details of the integration is outside the purview of the story definition. However, the story needs to define sufficient scenarios to drive the downstream technical analysis. 

<img src="/images/UserStories/5_IntegrationDriven.webp" />

#### Credit card authorization:
<p> <b>As a customer about to make a purchase, I need to be able to submit my credit card details and get authorization so that I can complete my checkout.</b></p>
Acceptance criteria:

    Scenario 1: Successful authorization
        When the user enters the credit-card-number, year-and-month-of-expiry and cvv and selects “sign-in” CTA and authorization is successful, then display “payment confirmation” message and persist authorization token for future reference (i.e, for sending for settlement)
    Scenario 2: Unsuccessful authorization - Incorrect card details
        When the user enters incorrect credit-card-number or year-and-month-of-expiry or cvv and selects “sign-in” CTA and authorization fails, then display “payment failed” error-message and reset the payment fields
    Scenario 3: Unsuccessful authorization - Insufficient balance
        When the user enters the correct credit-card-number, year-and-month-of-expiry, cvv of a card with insufficient balance and selects “sign-in” CTA and authorization fails, then display “payment failed” error-message and reset the payment fields
    Scenario 4: Unsuccessful authorization - Fraud
        When the user enters the credit-card-number, year-and-month-of-expiry, cvv and selects “sign-in” CTA and authorization fails due to suspected fraud, then display “error page” and keep the order on hold for ‘suspected fraud’
    Scenario 5: Payment gateway connectivity problem
        When the user enters the credit-card-number, year-and-month-of-expiry, cvv and selects “sign-in” CTA and connection to payment gateway fails, then display “call customer service” message and reset the payment fields

#### Order submission for fulfillment: 
<p><b>“As a customer who made a purchase, I need to get my order fulfilled correctly in a timely manner so that I don’t have to follow-up via customer service.</b></p>
Acceptance criteria:

    1) Send order details to the fulfillment system within 30 minutes of customer completing the checkout process.
    2) Send all required data so that picking, packing, settlement and shipping can happen for all order scenarios. 
        order scenarios:
        * Order placed by a guest user
        * Order placed by a registered user
        * Order placed by a registered user with a loyalty account
        * Order with just one item
        * Order with multiple items
        * Order with at least one item with quantity >1
        * Order with payment via credit card
        * Order with payment via gift card
        * Order with payment via both credit card and gift card
        * Order where shipping and billing address are same
        * Order where shipping and billing address are not the same
        * Order with multiple shipping addresses
        * Order with express shipping
        * Order with standard shipping
        * Order with free shipping
        * Order with shipping to a state with no sales tax
        * Order with at least one item with a sale price
        * Order with an order-level promotion
        * Order with an item-level promotion

### Granularity of a Story

Regardless of the type of story that is being written, there are two rules that govern the granularity of a story:

    The first rule: The story needs to represent a meaningful product increment to the product user.
        For example, if we are building a registration page, having two stories - one to display the form, and another to submit the form doesn’t make sense. Each individual story in this case doesn’t make any sense to the product user. We need a single story that can display the form and accept form submission. If there are any optional independent sections on the form (say a loyalty registration section), we could have a separate story to cover just that. 
    The second rule: The story needs to be small enough for the team to implement in one sprint.
        A story may need to be split into multiple stories depending on the team’s experience and sprint duration. It’s perfectly fine to wait until refinement or planning with the team before doing this splitting. 

### Readability of a Story
It seems obvious, but it’s worth stating: a story needs to be easily readable. 
Here are some tips:

    Pay attention to spelling and grammar.
    Use numbered lists wherever possible. In cases where numbering doesn’t make sense for a list, use bullets.
    Use indentation where applicable.
    When providing links to UX/UI artifacts, or other specifications as part of acceptance criteria, use plain text for the “hyperlink text” instead of the URL to avoid clutter.
    Use white space (line breaks) between sections or scenarios.

### User Story vs. Task
Finally, a team may often need to perform multiple activities as part of realizing a story. Some common examples are the following:
* 1.Conducting user research
* 2.Building wireframes
* 3.Analysis and design
* 4.Documentation of the design
* 5.Building UI components
* 6.Writing test cases
* 7.Automating test cases

These are tasks and not user stories. Therefore they do not need to follow user story guidelines. Rather, the team is expected to come up with the list of tasks required for a story during planning. 

### Benefits of user stories
User stories offer numerous benefits for an Agile project. 
Here are a few examples:
* <b>Simplified format:</b> User stories are written in easy-to-understand language. This eliminates confusion and makes it easier to grasp what the customer is looking for.
* <b>Increased flexibility:</b> Because user stories don’t go into technical detail, they can be molded to fit changing situations.
* <b>Improved collaboration:</b> When team members are aligned on one goal, they can work better together and collaborate easily with other project stakeholders.

### Disadvantages of user stories
Though the benefits of writing user stories are significant, a product manager must also consider the potential disadvantages. Here are a few user story pitfalls to watch out for:
* <b>Incomplete stories:</b> Though the language is intended to be informal, sometimes user stories are far too vague and exclude necessary details.
* <b>Insufficient time:</b> Writing a good story takes time. It requires extensive research and regular communication with stakeholders, a fact that is sometimes overlooked.
* <b>Narrow vision:</b> Because user stories focus on one single requirement, they can be hard to scale, and teams can sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture (in this case, an epic).
Before you start your story, take some time to identify potential risks or disadvantages and outline how you aim to counteract them.
