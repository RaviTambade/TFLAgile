   - Verify integration with third-party services and external systems.
   - Ensure compliance with requirements and industry standards.

**3. Testing Approach:**
   - Use a combination of manual and automated testing techniques.
   - Conduct both functional and non-functional testing activities.
   - Prioritize testing based on criticality and risk.
   - Involve cross-functional teams in testing activities.

**4. Testing Activities:**
   - Functional Testing:
     - User registration and login.
     - Product browsing and search.
     - Shopping cart and checkout.
     - User account management.
     - Payment processing.
   - Non-functional Testing:
     - Performance testing (load, stress, scalability).
     - Security testing (vulnerability assessment, penetration testing).
     - Usability testing (UX, accessibility, localization).
     - Reliability testing (availability, fault tolerance, recovery).
     - Compatibility testing (browser, device, operating system).
   - Integration Testing:
     - Integration with payment gateways.
     - Integration with shipping providers.
     - Integration with inventory management systems.

**5. Test Environment:**
   - Use a dedicated testing environment separate from production.
   - Replicate production-like configurations, including hardware, software, and network settings.
   - Use test data representative of real-world scenarios.

**6. Test Cases:**
   - Develop test cases covering various functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Include positive and negative test scenarios to validate system behavior.
   - Document test case descriptions, steps, expected results, and actual results.

**7. Test Execution:**
   - Execute test cases according to the test plan and schedule.
   - Record test results, including defects, issues, and observations.
   - Prioritize and triage defects based on severity and impact.

**8. Test Reporting:**
   - Prepare test reports summarizing test results, findings, and recommendations.
   - Communicate test status and progress to project stakeholders.
   - Include metrics such as test coverage, defect density, and test execution status.

**9. Test Closure:**
   - Review test results and lessons learned.
   - Update test documentation based on feedback and improvements.
   - Obtain sign-off from project stakeholders.

**10. Schedule:**
   - Testing activities will be conducted over a period of [duration], starting from [start date] to [end date].
   - Test cycles and milestones will be defined based on project timelines and priorities.

**11. Resources:**
   - Testing team members responsible for test planning, execution, and reporting.
   - Development team members for support and collaboration.
   - Access to testing tools, environments, and documentation.

**12. Risks and Assumptions:**
   - Risks: Potential risks include resource constraints, schedule delays, and unforeseen technical challenges.
   - Assumptions: Testing activities assume availability of necessary resources, access to test environments, and cooperation from stakeholders.

**13. Approval:**
   - This test plan requires approval from project stakeholders before testing activities commence.
