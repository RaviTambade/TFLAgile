Function-oriented and object-oriented systems are two different approaches to organizing and designing software. Let's break down their characteristics:

**Function-oriented System:**

1. **Focus on Functions**: In function-oriented systems, the primary focus is on functions or procedures. Programs are structured around a set of functions that perform specific tasks.

2. **Procedural Programming**: Function-oriented systems often use procedural programming languages like C. The emphasis is on writing procedures or functions to accomplish tasks, with data passed between functions as needed.

3. **Data and Functions are Separate**: In function-oriented systems, data and functions are typically separate entities. Data is often stored in global variables and passed to functions as parameters.

4. **Top-Down Design**: Function-oriented design typically follows a top-down approach, where the main program calls various functions to perform tasks in a hierarchical manner.

5. **Limited Reusability**: Functions in function-oriented systems are often tightly coupled with specific tasks, limiting their reusability across different parts of the program.

**Object-oriented System:**

1. **Focus on Objects**: Object-oriented systems focus on objects, which encapsulate both data and functions (methods) that operate on that data.

2. **OOP Languages**: Object-oriented systems use languages like Java, C++, Python, etc., which support object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

3. **Encapsulation**: Objects encapsulate data and behavior within a single unit. This encapsulation helps in better managing complexity and hiding implementation details.

4. **Inheritance**: Object-oriented systems support inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and behavior from other objects. This promotes code reuse and facilitates creating hierarchical relationships between objects.

5. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly, enabling flexibility and extensibility in the design.

6. **Modularity**: Object-oriented systems promote modularity by organizing code into classes and objects, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

7. **Bottom-Up Design**: Object-oriented design often follows a bottom-up approach, where smaller, reusable objects are designed first and then combined to create larger systems.

In summary, while function-oriented systems focus on procedures and separate data from functions, object-oriented systems focus on objects that encapsulate both data and behavior. Object-oriented systems offer advantages such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and modularity, which promote code reuse, maintainability, and scalability.
