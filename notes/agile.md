# Agile Methodology

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating

Teams choose to adopt an Agile approach because it helps break workloads into manageable chunks, drive continual improvement of products and internal processes, and typically results in faster, incremental delivery.

In contrast to a Waterfall Methodology, which is a linear approach building up to a more definitive ‘launch’, Agile results in gradual but continual improvement. It’s ongoing, more flexible and adaptable to change, producing outcomes faster and improving them over time

## Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a document that identifies four key values and 12 principles that its authors believe software developers should use to guide their work. Formally called the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, it was produced by 17 developers during an outing on Feb. 11-13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in Utah.

The developers called themselves the Agile Alliance. They were seeking an alternative to the existing software development processes that they saw as complicated, unresponsive and too focused on documentation requirements. Among the developers were Kent Beck, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Andrew Hunt, Robert Martin and Jeff Sutherland. Members of the initial alliance were experienced in software development and business entrepreneurship.

Agile project management brings together Agile teams of programmers, stakeholders and users to support Agile principles. Team members conduct face-to-face conversations, both in person and remotely, and they communicate regularly as part of the primary measure of progress. This approach supports the key aspect of the Agile process -- developing software in increments with user input along the way, as opposed to a final product with minimal user interaction.

* Agile Methodology operates according to its <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto </a> which contains four, core principles:


### The 4 Values of Agile

The four core values of Agile software development as stated in the Agile Manifesto are as follows:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a project plan.

### The 12 Principles

The Agile Manifesto goes beyond scoping out a software project and then developing and releasing it. Perhaps the most important aspect of the manifesto is the close coordination and regular interactions with those who will be using the new or updated software.

The following are the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto:

* Meeting end users' needs with early and continuous delivery of work.
* Being open to changes in requirements even late in the project.
* Delivering completed work at regular intervals, preferably short ones.
* Working with the project team and business owners daily.
* Assembling a motivated team, providing them with the right environment and support, and trusting them.
* Communicating face-to-face regularly.
* Using completed work to measure progress.
* Creating processes that promote sustainable efforts and a constant pace of work.
* Requiring continuous attention to excellence through good design.
* Encouraging simplicity.
* Recognizing that the best work emerges from self-organized teams that deliver the best architectures and designs.
* Reflecting regularly on how the team can be more effective and fine-tuning and adjusting the approach.

## Agile Framework

An agile framework can be defined as a specific Software-Development Approach based on the Agile Philosophy articulated in the Agile Manifesto. Most agile teams use frameworks only as a starting point for their agile transformation, eventually customizing elements to meet their unique needs. Various organizations use many popular frameworks. Often these organizations modify parts of the frameworks as they see fit and iterate on their own agile processes. 

### Popular Frameworks

* <b>Scrum</b>
It is about managing knowledge work, with an assurance on the new improvement of the software. It was created for small teams that are consist of three to nine members, they will divide their tasks to a number of activities which will be done inside the timeboxed iterations, called " sprints ", and these activities will not exceed one month to be done and most usually couple of weeks to finish these activities, at that point tracking the progress and then planning again in 15-minute stand-up gatherings, called day by day scrums. 

* <b>eXtreme Programming (XP)</b>
The main purposes are to improve the software’s quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a kind of agile progress, it advocates visit "deliveries" in a short time of improvement cycles, which is intended to upgrade efficiency and present checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be embraced. 

* <b>Dynamic Systems Development Method (DDSM)</b>
Rather than settling measures of functionality in an item, afterward changing time and assets that will achieve the functionality, will be better to fix the time and resources, then afterward modifying all measure of functionality appropriately. 

* <b>Feature Driven Development (FDD)</b>
The main focus is the designing and building stages and the priority is the quality viewpoints all through the whole progress and incorporates repeated and sensible deliveries, alongside with careful observation of the project’s process. 

* <b>The Crystal Method</b>
It focuses on individuals and the communication among them while they work on a software development project. There is additional attention on business-criticality and business-need of the framework under development. Unlike traditional development methods, Crystal doesn't fix the apparatuses and systems of development, however, it keeps individuals International Journal of Computer Science & Information Technology (IJCSIT) Vol 11, No 4, August 2019 and processes at the center of the improvement processes. Also, it isn't just the people or the processes that are matters, rather the communication between the two that is what matters the
most. 


* <b>Lean Software Development (LSD)</b>
Lean agile is a development method that helps teams identify waste and refine processes. It’s a guiding mindset that facilitates efficiency, effectiveness, and continuous improvement. Consider this: You probably work a lot better when your desk isn’t completely covered with a mess of things you don’t need.

### Which Agile Framework is Best?

There is no one-size-fits-all way to practice Agile Software Development. Many factors may influence which framework you choose to work with. Such as:

* Company size
* Team structure
* Available resources
* Needs of stakeholders
* Structure/size of your product portfolio

Each framework has its own unique set of strengths and weaknesses. And the framework that works for someone else’s team might not be the right one for you. So ultimately, you’ll have to experiment a bit and figure out what works best for you.
